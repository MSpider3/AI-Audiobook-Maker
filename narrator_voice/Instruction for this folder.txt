In this folder you will keep the voice for your audiobook that you wish to clone.

Things to keep in mind while selecting narrator voice:
- Take 10-15 second audio clip in .wav format of narrator.
- In that voice clip it has best narration in single voice of that narrator (meaning that narrator shouldn't be speaking in different styles across the entire clip, it should be same).

How you can do it?
- Open chatbot of your choice and ask them what voice would fit best for the novel you want to convert.
- Find their best works and download the sample of their.
- Convert from .mp3 to .wav format.
- Trim the best part of the sample if the clip is long suing any audio editing software/website.
- and the place them in this folder.
